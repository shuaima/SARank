\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec-conclusion}

In this article we have introduced approximation computation techniques toward efficient and effective big data analytics. 


First we see the importance of graph search by investigating the applications in industry, academia research developments, and the historical development of search.
And then, we have introduced and analyzed three types of graph search: cohesive subgraph,keyword search on graphs and graph
pattern matching. Finally, we have pointed out the problems and challenges graph search confronts and presented some useful techniques to deal with the problems.\par
\, As a a new paradigm for social computing, graph search has received extensive attentions. However, there are still a lot of questions to be solved in graph search, which is also a challenge for us.\par
